# Zfish_pos_pred
This repository contains the code used for my master thesis on positional prediction of cells in Zebrafish embryos.
The repository is structured as follow:
In Scripts folder, my python scripts are organise in categories, with inside each category python scripts that were used in my thesis, and an other_versions folder with other scripts related to the same subject.
The folder initialisation contains the scripts that should be run first in order to be able to execute the other scripts. These are the files setting the coordinates system for each embryo.
The folder heatmaps contains the code generating the heatmaps shown in the thesis.
The folder positional prediction contains the two methods presented: Bayesian approach and random forest classifier
The folder fate prediction contains the code to run the prediction of fate markers in each bins. 
The folder df contains the datasets that were used, with initialization step already performed on it.
The folder Other contains other scripts and methods that were tried or used.

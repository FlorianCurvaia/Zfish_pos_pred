# Zfish_pos_pred
This repository contains the code used for my master thesis on positional prediction of cells in Zebrafish embryos.
The repository is structured as follow:
In Scripts folder, my python scripts are organise in categories, with inside each category python scripts that were used in my thesis, and an other_versions folder with other scripts related to the same subject.
The folder initialisation contains the scripts that should be run first in order to be able to execute the order scripts.
